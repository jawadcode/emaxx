# Emaxx

Yet another emacs config.

## Why

I wanted to try [elpaca](https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca), [eglot](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eglot.html) and [treesit-auto](https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto) again,
and also try [meow](https://github.com/meow-edit/meow) for the first time (with its [treesit.el integration](https://github.com/skissue/meow-tree-sitter)).

``` rust
fn main() {
	println!("Hello World");
}
```
